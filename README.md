Description

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data to identify demand patterns, time-based trends, and ride distribution. The project includes data cleaning, feature analysis, and visualizations using Python to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

Methodology

•	Handled missing and inconsistent values

•	Removed duplicates and standardized columns

•	Performed univariate and time-based analysis

•	Created visualizations to understand ride demand patterns

Results

•	Peak ride demand observed during specific hours and days

•	Clear temporal patterns in Uber ride frequency

•	Data cleaning improved consistency and analytical accuracy

•	Visual analysis revealed trends useful for planning and forecasting

Tools and Libraries

•	Python

•	Pandas

•	NumPy

•	Matplotlib

•	Seaborn

Objective

To demonstrate practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and insight generation using real-world transportation data.
